# Auto Collision Adder

Auto Collision Adder is a custom Unity Editor tool that lets you quickly add colliders to multiple objects in your scene.  
It provides flexible filtering options and a live preview of which objects will be affected before applying changes.

---

## Features

- Add different types of colliders:
  - Box Collider
  - Mesh Collider
  - Sphere Collider
  - Capsule Collider
- Powerful filters:
  - By object **name** (string contains)
  - By **tag**
  - By **layer**
  - By **3D section box** (interactive box in Scene View)
- Option to **include child objects**
- **Preview** of all objects matching the filters
- **Confirmation dialog** before colliders are applied
- Undo support (`Ctrl+Z`) for added colliders

---

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Copy the `AutoCollisionAdder.cs` file into your Unity project (e.g., inside `Assets/Editor/`).
3. Open Unity and wait for it to compile.

## Usage

1. Open the tool from the menu:  
   **`Tools > Auto Collision Adder`**
2. Choose a **Collider Type** from the dropdown.
3. Select the **filters** you want to apply:
   - All Objects (ignores filters)
   - Name Filter – matches objects containing a string
   - Tag Filter – matches objects with a specific tag
   - Layer Filter – matches objects on a given layer
   - Section Filter (3D Box) – use a draggable/resizable box in the Scene View to select objects
4. (Optional) Enable **Include Children** to also affect child objects.
5. Click **"Add Colliders to Objects"**.
6. A confirmation dialog will show how many objects will be affected. Confirm to apply.

## Requirements

- Unity 2021.3 LTS or newer (tested)
- Works with Built-in Render Pipeline, URP, and HDRP

---

## Example Use Cases

- Quickly adding colliders to imported environment assets.
- Bulk-adding colliders to objects by tag (e.g., "Interactable").
- Using the 3D box filter to add colliders only to objects within a certain area of the scene.

---

## Roadmap / Ideas

- Highlight objects in the Scene View that match current filters (preview with outlines).
- Support for custom collider settings (size, convex, etc.).
- Export/Import filter presets.
